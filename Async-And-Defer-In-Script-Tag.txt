The async and defer attributes on a <script> tag are used to control how and when external JavaScript files are loaded and executed by the browser, aiming to improve page loading performance.


ASYNC:

- Once the script is downloaded, its execution begins immediately, potentially pausing HTML parsing to do so. 
- This means scripts with async are not guaranteed to execute in the order they appear in the HTML.
- async is generally for scripts that don't need the DOM ready. defer is for scripts that require the DOM to be parsed or need a specific execution order.



DEFER:

- Unlike async, the execution of defer-ed scripts is postponed until the entire HTML document has been parsed and the DOM is ready, but before the DOMContentLoaded event fires. 
- If multiple defer-ed scripts are present, they are guaranteed to execute in the order they appear in the HTML.
- defer is for scripts that require the DOM to be parsed or need a specific execution order.


Mutual Exclusivity:

While you can technically include both async and defer on a script tag, "async takes precedence if both are present and supported". 
It is generally recommended to choose the attribute that best fits the script's requirements.
