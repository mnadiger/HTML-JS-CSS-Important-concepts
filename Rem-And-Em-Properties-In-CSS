In CSS, em and rem are relative units of measurement used for sizing elements, particularly for font sizes, but also for other properties like margin and padding. 
  
  The key difference lies in their reference point:


em units:

  -  Are relative to the font size of the parent element. 
  -  If a parent element has a font-size of 16px, then 1em within a child element of that parent will equal 16px.
  -  This means that em units can lead to compounding effects in nested elements, where the size of an element is determined by its immediate parent, 
    which in turn is determined by its own parent, and so on. 
  -  This can make scaling challenging in deeply nested structures.


rem units:

  -  Are relative to the font size of the root HTML element (the <html> tag). 
  -  This provides a consistent and predictable base for sizing throughout the entire document, as 1rem will always refer to the font size set on the <html> element, regardless of any parent element's font size.
  -  This makes rem units generally easier to manage for overall page scaling and responsive design, as you can adjust the base font size on the <html> element to scale the entire page proportionally.



When to use each:

  -  rem is generally preferred for overall layout and global typography
        where you want consistent scaling relative to a single root value. This simplifies responsive design, as changing the root font size scales everything predictably.

  -  em can be useful for component-level scaling
        where you want an element's size to be relative to its immediate parent. For example, using em for padding on a button ensures the padding scales proportionally with the button's font size.
